    <p>The properties defined in the CSS multi-column layout module extend the block layout mode , enabling the easy
        definition of multiple columns of text. People have trouble reading text if lines are too long. </p>
    <p class="black">One</p> <!--black-->
    <p>If it takes too
        long for the eyes to move from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, readers can lose track of which
        line they were on. To provide for a better user experience when reading text making use of a large screen, you
        should limit the width of text by using columns of text placed side by side, just as newspapers do.</p>
